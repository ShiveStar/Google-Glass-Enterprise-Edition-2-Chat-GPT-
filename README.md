This app allows you to use the Chat GPT API agent of your choice with your Google Glass EE2. To get this working do the following steps:
1. Open key.txt and add your API key where it says "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
2. If unhappy with the current model, change the line below the above section as well
3. Next, use adb too push the file "key.txt" to /sdcard. Example: adb push /path/to/key.txt /sdcard
4. Run the app! The first time it will ask for permission to access your files (to get to the key.txt). Simply press allow and relaunch the app!
